# k-means_modeling_penguins
I made a K-means model to cluster data from a dataset that includes datapoints across a sample size of 345 penguins, such as species, island, and sex, as they relate to a study by PLOS ONE of sexual dimorphism among penguins (essentialy, physical differences between males and females of the same species).
